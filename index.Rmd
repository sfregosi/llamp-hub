### About this site
This repo is the *new* and *improved* Longline Acoustic Monitoring Project central hub - for code, documentation, and guides to data organization. 

The web address for this repository is: [github.com/sfregosi/llamp](https://github.com/sfregosi/llamp)

This site needs to remain private (at least for now) so the best way to interact with it is to clone the repository to your local machine, then open the ../llamp/docs/site/index.html. This will open the main page (this one!) in a browser window and all links will work as a sort of local intranet page. 

#### Site Contents
[**Summary**](summary.html) - High level summary of work conducted so far

**Protocols** - Menu to detailed protocols for specific components/steps of the project: vessel recruitment, hardware, data processing, analysis, and reporting. 

[**DriveDocs**](driveLinks.html) - links and descriptions of important docs and sheets on Google Drive. Access to individual links is restricted based on sharing settings. 

**2022 Manuscript** - Menu to a [Data Guide](simonis_data_guide.html) for finding relevant analysis outputs on GDrive and a [Comparison](bayless_simonis_comp.html) doc for comparison of charter results to Bayless et al. 2017

### About the Longline Acoustic Monitoring Project (LLAMP)
The Longline Acoustic Monitoring Project (recently dubbed LLAMP) is a collaborative project between NOAA NMFS PIFSC and the Hawaiian longline fleet to better understand how and why false killer whales interact with the fishery, and try to reduce these interactions. 

This project has been going on for many years and involves many wonderful people!
