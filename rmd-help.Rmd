```{r setup, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = 'center')

library(fontawesome)
library(xaringanExtra)
library(htmltools)
```

```{r, xaringanExtra-clipboard, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tagList(
  xaringanExtra::use_clipboard(
    button_text = "<i class=\"fa fa-clone fa-2x\" style=\"color: #301e64\"></i>",
    success_text = "<i class=\"fa fa-check fa-2x\" style=\"color: #90BE6D\"></i>",

This page is a 'hidden' (meaning it isn't linked anywhere within the `llamp-hub`) page as sort of a copy/paste clipboard for useful bits of rmd code that are used often within this site. 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## how to use FontAwesome icons

`r fa(name = "person-digging")`


# Figures
Example for including a static image:

```{r fkw, fig.cap="false killer whale"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/640x427-false-killer-whale.png")
```

# References
To reference to stuff within the page, like Figure. \@ref(fig:fkw)
