## Longline Acoustic Monitoring Project (LLAMP) Hub

`r fa(name = "calendar-check")` *Last Update: `r format(Sys.Date(), "%d %b %Y")`*

This site serves as the central 'hub' for all protocols related to the Longline Acoustic Monitoring Project (LLAMP). It is hosted on GitHub pages to enable easy access to our team when working from home or in the lab. This contains limited information (so some links may be broken) related to LLAMP to keep protected information out of this public repository. Additional analyses and info can be found in the main, private [llamp](https://github.com/sfregosi/llamp-hub) repository. Contact S. Fregosi to request access to that repository. 

The best link to bookmark is:
