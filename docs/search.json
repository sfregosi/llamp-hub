Note any problems or inconsistencies for each recorder in the ‘notes’ column\r\nDataSummary_IA: added 7 rows, copying the ‘Status’ and ‘Location’ column values from an earlier trip\r\nDepredation: provide a summary of the trip dates and Y or N for depredation with notes on specifically which sets, if any, had bait or catch depredation\r\nProcessingStatus: add a row for each recorder deployed and use this track steps as they are completed for each recorder + any notes on issues\r\nAnalysisStatus: add a row for each recorder and track analysis steps (below) here\r\nBouts: not used for now. Current data is from Phase I and II analyses and is just left there as a placeholder\r\n\r\nCreate README_LL0##.txt file on server (//PICQUEENFISH/PSD2/CRP/LLHARP) within the folder for this trip. This README will house any notes about data issues/trip inconsistencies while working through post-processing and analysis steps\r\nCheck observer datasheets for readability and combine if needed (if photographed rather than scanned)\r\nIn Adobe Acrobat Pro: File > Create > Combine Files into a Single PDF…\r\nDrag or select all photo files\r\nUse the Scan & OCR tools to ‘Enhance’ each page\r\nAfter selecting Scan & OCR on the right hand tools menu, click Enhance > Camera Image from the top tools menu\r\nPage borders will appear. Adjust the extent of the page borders to include the whole page and exclude any background and click Enhance Page\r\nThe default enhance level usually obscures some of the entries so reduce the enhancement level using the Adjust enhancement level slider until it is readable\r\nClick on the next thumbnail to repeat for the next page\r\n\r\nSave within the trip’s server folder with the filename LL0##_observer_sheets_photos.pdf\r\n\r\nTranscribe underwater and in-air datasheets to .xlsx\r\nUse the blank template found on SF’s local machine at C:\\Users\\Selene.Fregosi\\Documents\\longline_local\\tripExcelSummaries\\\r\nLL000_Summary_phase3_template.xlsx or in the llamp repository at LL000_Summary_phase3template.xlsx\r\nSave the template as LL0##_Summary.xlsx within this trip’s server folder\r\nFill in observer noted set/haul/recorder deployment times in the Summary tab\r\nFill in observer noted in-air recording times and filenames in the In-air tab\r\nUpdated the 4 RecorderTimes_FR## tabs with the correct frame numbers\r\n\r\nReview underwater data LTSA in Triton\r\nMark actual recorder in/out times from the acoustics and record the in/out times in the RecorderTimes tab(s) of LL0##_summary.xlsx created above\r\nUse one tab per recorder/LTSA\r\nRecordings are in UTC, so note in/out times in UTC and subtract 10 hours to also convert to local time for comparison to observer noted times\r\n\r\nNote data availability and quality in the DataSummary_UW tab of phase_3_multi_deployments_summary.xlsx\r\nFill green for audio, red for no audio\r\nNote the recorder deployment order (1-4) for each set\r\nMake comments for any irregularities found such as noise, on deck recordings (recorder did not automatically turn off after recovery), data gaps, etc.\r\nReport any problems with noise or missing data to the LLHARP hardware manager (likely Erik Norris)\r\n\r\n\r\nReview in-air data in Raven (or other?)\r\nLoad all files for a single recorder (e.g. Z03 or Z04) by selecting all files and dragging into the Raven window\r\nSelect Page files and set page length to 120 or 180 seconds\r\nEach file is separated by a green dashed line; can move through files with black arrow at top right or by selecting the file number from the dropdown\r\n\r\nConfirm file numbers, durations, and voice comments align with what is on the datasheet and transcribed to L0##_summary.xlsx\r\nNote data availability and quality in the DataSummary_IA tab of phase_3_multi_deployments_summary.xlsx\r\nFill green for audio, red for no audio\r\nSpecify the file number for each set and recording sample\r\nNote any irregularities such as missing data or incorrect timing\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to top\r\nProcess trip\r\nRun workflow_processTrip.m to work through converting the summary docs to .mat, running some log checks, and splitting up .xwavs that span multiple sets.\r\nSet trip information in top section (unnumbered) of workflow_processTrip.m\r\nTrip number trip = on line 41\r\nFrames to process (default is frToProcess = 'all'; on line 43\r\nPaths on lines 46 to 62\r\n\r\nRun section (1) to convert LL0##_Summary.xlsx times and locations to a .mat file\r\nCheck for timing inconsistencies as prompted\r\nCheck any location inconsistencies from the generated plot\r\nNote any issues and try to fix discrepancies where possible, noting these issues or corrections in the README\r\n\r\nRun section (2) to manually enter the frame and datalogger numbers when prompted\r\nThe format should be FR##_DL## (e.g., FR04_DL64)\r\nHit Enter after each entry, and Enter again after all are entered to exit input state\r\n\r\nRun section (3) to summarize the recording durations, from the observer noted times and the acoustic record\r\nManually check durations for any large discrepancies between the acoustic record and observer log\r\nIf corrections are needed, make these corrections and note them in the README\r\n\r\nRun section (4) to work through the xwavs that span across sets and split the files as needed to preserve recording timing information for later analysis\r\nThis section will pause after calculating the number of file gaps. Manually compare this number to the observations in the manually marked recorder in/out times and if they match, hit Enter to continue\r\nThis section will take some time and will save ‘original’ xwavs before writing new, split xwavs\r\nUpdate the README with info on the number of original xwavs, gaps, and deck test or on deck recordings and any other relevent notes\r\n\r\nOptional, run section (5) to plot the drifts again and TDR data, for reporting purposes. Section 5 is under development\r\nBack to top\r\nFinal checks\r\nAfter workflow_processTrip.m, finalize the created ltsas and summary docs.\r\nIf xwavs were split, remake the LTSA in Triton\r\nUse a 5 sec/100 Hz resolution for odontocete analysis\r\nName the LTSA LL0##_FR##_DL##_5s_100Hz_splitFiles.ltsa and save within the xwavs folder\r\n\r\nMake a finer resolution LTSA for noise analysis\r\nUse a 2 sec/10 Hz resolution\r\nName the file LL0##_FR##_DL##_2s_10Hz.ltsa and save within the xwavs folder\r\n\r\nFinalize the README and phase_3_multi_deployments_summary.xslx by ensuring all inconsitencies are noted, and data checks completed, and all processing steps are done\r\nBack to top\r\nAcoustic analyses\r\nCreate GitHub issue\r\nCreate a new issue to add this task to the Longline Acoustic Monitoring Project\r\nNavigate to the llamp repository’s New Issue page and press the green Get Started button for the Analysis template\r\nUpdate the created issue name with the correct trip number, add any assignees, and add to the Longline Acoustic Monitoring Project\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Screenshot showing the new issue template selection page on GitHub\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOdontocetes\r\nManually scan LTSAs to define start/end time of odontocete acoustic events\r\nin Triton\r\nnote potential species ID as possible\r\nEither omit or separately log sperm whale events\r\n\r\nRun Pamguard detector suite - click, whistle, burst pulse\r\nuse PAM2016_LLHARP_BANTER.psfx\r\nFor speed, the detectors can be run only over files with known odontocete events by hand selecting just the files of interest\r\n\r\nExtract features of click, whistle, and burst pulse detections in PAMpal\r\nList the code here…\r\n\r\nUse banter to predict species label\r\nSpecify the model and code scripts here\r\n\r\nNoise\r\nRun Pamguard detector using PAM2016_LLHARP_noise.psfx\r\nManually scan LTSAs to define start/end time of gear noise\r\nRun TOL noise detectors (option to use SanctSound metrics or PG noise module)\r\nUpdate list of vessels with gear noise detected\r\nIn-Air\r\nUnder development\r\n- Review Zoom recordings to characterize sound\r\nBack to top\r\nPast protocols\r\nLLHARP Part III - Data Analysis Google DocLast updated 24 March 2017\r\n- Manual scanning of LTSAs in Triton to find bouts, whistle classification using Raven to generate manual whistle picks plus ROCCA to trace and classify, and click detection and classification using a a set of Matlab tools (appears to be Triton-based but not sure on specific versions)\r\n- This is the approach used in Bayless et al. 2017\r\nBack to top\r\nLast updated\r\n 07 February 2023\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
